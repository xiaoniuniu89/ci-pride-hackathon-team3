## **DESIGN**
### **Colour Scheme**
The colours used in the design of US Together were obtained from the [Adobe Color website](https://color.adobe.com/). The colours were inspired by a mix of rainbow colours which signify diversity while encouraging togetherness. A strong symbol of the LGBTQ+ community in order to build trust with our brand and stimulate their curiosity by using aesthetically pleasing images that catch our users' attention and provide a welcoming safe haven.

### **Typography**
The [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Roboto and Montserrat font were chosen for their bold and clean nature to give the site a friendly clean minimalist design. A backup font has also been included sans-serif.

### **Imagery**
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
### **Wireframes**

The entire site's wireframe was done using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) & Balmasiq.This depicts the site on a desktop and a mobile device.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
