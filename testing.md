### **VALIDATOR TESTING**
#### **HTML**
### W3C Validator
[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

Due to time we were unable to carry out test for some of the pages,only a few. 

* [Home Page W3C HTML Validation]() - Pass
* [Event Page W3C HTML Validation]() - Pass
* [Sign Up Page W3C HTML Validation]() Pass
* [Login Page W3C HTML Validation]()
* [Donate W3C HTML Validation]() - Pass
* [Event detail W3C HTML Validation]() - Pass
<br/>

#### **CSS**
* [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): This is used to validate the CSS code that is used on all webpages . The validator finds our code to be error-free.

 ![css validation for base.css]()

<br/>

#### **JAVASCRIPT**
* [JSHint validation ](https://jshint.com/):as used to validate the JavaScript.

* [JSHint validation for stripe.js]()

<br/>

#### **PYTHON**
* [Pep8 Online validator](http://pep8online.com/): This was used to run our Python code to ensure that all errors, such as trailing whitespace, were removed. When this was run through the validator, it was discovered that some whitespaces were present and that some variables had been flagged.This was fixed and re-ran the code was free from errors.

2. check to see if there are any new events I haven't seen previously.

### **MANUAL TESTING**

Some automated testing was performed, but due to time constraints, manual testing was prioritised.

### **FURTHER TESTING** 

This site was tested on a desktop (Mac OS and Windows), iPad, iPadPro, iPhone (6,7,8, and SE), and Pixel2 device to ensure that it was error-free and responsive on all pages. Additional testing was conducted by allowing some users to shop on the site.

Some feedbacks were provided.
